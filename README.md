# Trivision Imposition
A Trivision refers to a billboard structure that is cut up into panels(blades). They are shaped like a triangle and rotate to change the front facing image that is viewable. This script takes a Photoshop file and user input and cuts it into panels(blades). When doing this you must remove the gap that is between each blade.
